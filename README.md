# Cloth Sim
 Simple cloth simulation project

Utilizes Processing to create a simplistic cloth simulation model via the principle of Hooke's law spring dynamics.
Using Simon Schofield's SimObject library for shapes and rendering.

Originally used a floor texture, but for copyright reason it's omitted. To make it work simply add a placeholder texture called "floor.jpg" to the folder or remove the line that uses it.
